Setup Instructions

1. Copy the files to your own directory.

2. Modify inet.h to reflect the host you are currently logged into.
   Also, modify the port numbers to be used to reduce the likelihood
   of conflicting with another server.

3. Generate Certificates and Keys by running:	./generate_certs.sh

4. Compile the programs using "make".

==================================================================
Running Instructions

1. Start the server directory in the background: ./directoryServer5 &

2. Start a Chat Server. Replace <port> with port number of choice and <Room Name> with a supported chat room topic(see above):
./chatServer5 "<Room Name>" <port>

3. Start the client on the same or another host in the foreground: ./chatClient5

4. Connect to a chat room. The chat client will ask for ServerName, ServerIP, and ServerPort. Enter them in this format:
<Room Name>,<Chat Server IP>,<Chat Server Port>

Then you are set up to chat with others in the room!

5.Remember to kill the server before logging off.
